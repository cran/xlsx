\title{Read, write, format Excel 2007 and Excel 97/2000/XP/2003 files}
\description{
The \code{xlsx} package gives programatic control of Excel files using R.  A
high level API allows the user to read a sheet of an xlsx document into a
\code{data.frame} and write a \code{data.frame} to a file.  Lower level
functionality permits the direct manipulation of sheets, rows and cells.
For example, the user has control to set colors, fonts, data formats, add
borders, hide/unhide sheets, add/remove rows, add/remove sheets, etc.
}
\details{
Behind the scenes, the \code{xlsx} package uses a java library from the
Apache project, \url{http://poi.apache.org/index.html}.  This Apache project
provides a Java API to Microsoft Documents (Excel, Word, PowerPoint,
Outlook, Visio, etc.)  By using the \code{rJava} package that links and
Java, we can piggyback on the excellent work already done by the folks at
the Apache project and provide this functionality in R.  The \code{xlsx}
package uses only a subset of the Apache POI project, namely the one dealing
with Excel files.  All the necessary jar files are kept in package
\code{xlsxjars} that is imported by package \code{xlsx}.

A collection of tests that can be used as examples are located in folder
\code{/tests/}.  They are a good source of examples of how to use the
package.

are looking for something that is not exposed in R as it may be available on
the Java side.  Inspecting the source code for some the the functions in
this package can show you how to do it (even if you are Java shy.)
